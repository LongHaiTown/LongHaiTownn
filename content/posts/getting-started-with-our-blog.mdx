# Welcome

This sample post is fully compatible with the current setup and should render correctly at `/blog/getting-started-with-our-blog`.

## What you'll see

- Frontmatter-driven title, date, category, tags, and hero image
- MDX headings, lists, links, and code blocks
- Dark mode-friendly typography via `prose`

## Links

Visit the [Blog](/blog) to see the list and open this post.

## Code Block

```ts
export function hello(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}

console.log(hello('World'))
```

## Next Steps

- Add more posts under `content/posts/*.mdx`
- Use the same frontmatter keys for consistent listing and detail pages
- Optional: add images via the `heroImage` field

### Closing

Happy writing!
