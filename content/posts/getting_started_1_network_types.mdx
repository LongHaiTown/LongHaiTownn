# Network Types

> Before talking about how networks work, it is worth slowing down and asking a quieter question:  
> **what do we actually mean when we say “a network”?**

This series approaches networking not as a checklist of technologies, but as a way of understanding how connections shape systems.  
This first post looks at *network types*, not as rigid categories, but as perspectives that help us see how the same idea behaves at different scales.

## Why classify networks at all?

When people talk about networks, they often talk past each other.

One person means the Wi-Fi at home.  
Another means a company’s internal infrastructure.  
Someone else means the Internet as a whole.

All of these are valid, and yet they feel fundamentally different.

Classification, in this context, is not about putting labels on things.  
It is about creating **mental distance**, so we can notice how a single concept changes as it grows.

One of the simplest and most useful lenses for doing this is **scale**.

## A system grows before it becomes complicated

At its core, a network is just a set of connections.  
But scale quietly changes everything.

As a network grows, it does not merely connect more things.  
It reshapes how control works, how failure is experienced, and how visible the system remains to the people who depend on it.

Seen through this lens, three broad forms begin to emerge.

## Local Networks

Local networks are where networking feels concrete.

They exist close to us: in our homes, small offices, classrooms, and cafés.  
They are limited in scope, visible in behavior, and personal in impact.

When a local network fails, the failure feels immediate and understandable.  
The Wi-Fi disconnects. A device cannot reach another device. Something that worked a moment ago suddenly does not.

What defines a local network is not its technology, but its **sense of enclosure**.  
There is a clear inside and outside.  
There is often a sense of ownership, or at least familiarity.

In this space, a network feels less like infrastructure and more like a shared environment.  
Almost like a room in which devices coexist and interact.

For many people, this is where the concept of networking first becomes real.

## Medium to Large Networks

![Medium to Large Networks](/blog/getting_started_1_network_types/Medium_to_Large_Networks.jpg)

As networks extend beyond a single physical space, their character begins to change.

Medium to large networks appear inside organizations, universities, and institutions.  
They connect buildings, departments, and roles rather than just devices.

At this scale, a network stops being something you casually notice and starts becoming something that quietly governs how things function.

You no longer see the whole network.  
You only experience your position within it.

Access becomes selective.  
Boundaries multiply.  
Rules emerge not because someone desires complexity, but because complexity becomes unavoidable.

If a local network feels like a room, a medium to large network feels like a building.  
You move through it, but you never fully perceive it.

Here, networking becomes inseparable from structure and responsibility.  
Questions shift from simple connectivity to coordination, reliability, and trust.

## World Wide Networks

World wide networks exist at a scale where intuition begins to fail.

The Internet is the most obvious example, but it is not merely a technical artifact.  
It is a global system composed of countless smaller networks, none of which control the whole.

Most of the time, we do not experience this network directly.  
We experience services layered on top of it: websites, messages, videos, cloud storage.

The network itself becomes invisible, not because it is simple, but because it is vast.

At this scale, control is distributed, responsibility is fragmented, and ownership is unclear.  
And yet, dependence is nearly universal.

World wide networks blur the line between infrastructure and society.  
They shape communication, economics, knowledge, and power without presenting themselves as a single entity.

What makes them fascinating is not simply that they exist, but that they function at all.

---

## A pattern across scales

Looking across these network types reveals a recurring pattern.

As networks grow, they move from being visible to being implicit.  
From personal to institutional.  
From understandable to taken for granted.

The underlying idea of connection remains the same, but its consequences expand far beyond the technical domain.

This is why studying networks is never only about cables or protocols.  
It is about how systems behave when connection becomes the default condition of existence.

---

## Closing thought

> A network does not become powerful because it is complex.  
> It becomes powerful because so much depends on it.

Understanding network types is a way of understanding how scale transforms simple connections into systems that quietly shape the world.
