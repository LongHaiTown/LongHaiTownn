## Connectivity Options

Before a home network can exist, there must be a way to connect it to the Internet.  
This connection is commonly referred to as **network connectivity**, or Internet access.

Connectivity describes *how* a local network reaches external networks through an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  
It is not the Internet itself, but the access path to it.

Different connectivity options exist because physical environments, infrastructure availability, and user needs vary.  
The most common types of Internet connectivity include cable, DSL, cellular, and satellite connections.

### Cable Connection

A cable connection provides Internet access using the same physical infrastructure originally built for cable television.  
It is commonly available in urban and suburban areas.

Cable Internet is a **shared medium**, meaning multiple users in the same area share network capacity.  
As a result, performance can vary depending on overall usage, especially during peak hours.

Cable connections typically offer relatively high download speeds and stable service, making them suitable for home networks with multiple devices and regular Internet use.


### DSL Connection

DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) provides Internet access over traditional telephone lines.  
Unlike cable, DSL connections are usually dedicated between the subscriber and the service provider.

The performance of DSL is strongly affected by distance.  
The farther a location is from the service provider’s equipment, the lower the achievable speed.

DSL is often available in areas where cable infrastructure is limited, and it remains in use as a transitional technology in many regions.


### Cellular Connection

Cellular connectivity uses mobile network infrastructure to provide Internet access.  
It is commonly used by smartphones, tablets, and mobile hotspots, and increasingly as a primary or backup connection for home networks.

Cellular connections support mobility, allowing devices to remain connected while moving between locations.  
However, performance can vary based on signal strength, network congestion, and geographic coverage.

Because cellular networks are shared among many users, speed and latency are not always consistent.  
Despite this variability, cellular connectivity plays a critical role in providing Internet access where wired options are unavailable or impractical.



### Satellite Connection

Satellite Internet provides connectivity by communicating with satellites orbiting the Earth.  
It is most commonly used in remote or rural areas where wired infrastructure does not exist.

Satellite connections offer wide geographic coverage, but they typically experience higher latency due to the long distance signals must travel.  
Environmental factors such as weather can also affect performance.

While satellite connectivity may not match the responsiveness of other options, it enables Internet access in locations that would otherwise remain disconnected.



### Comparing Connectivity Options

Each connectivity option reflects a balance between availability, performance, and reliability.

Cable and DSL rely on fixed infrastructure and are influenced by physical distance and local usage.  
Cellular connections emphasize flexibility and mobility but accept variability.  
Satellite connections prioritize coverage over responsiveness.

There is no single “best” connectivity option.  
The appropriate choice depends on location, infrastructure access, and usage requirements.

## Wireless Network

A wireless network allows devices to communicate without physical cables by using electromagnetic signals.  
Different wireless technologies exist to support communication over varying distances, speeds, and purposes.

### Global Positioning System (GPS)

GPS is a wireless system used for location and time synchronization rather than general data communication.  
It relies on satellites transmitting signals that receivers use to determine geographic position.

GPS is commonly used in navigation, mapping, and location-based services.  
Unlike other wireless technologies, GPS is primarily one-way communication from satellites to devices.


### Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology designed for local area networks.  
It is commonly used in homes, offices, and public spaces to connect devices to a local network and the Internet.

Wi-Fi operates over a limited range and allows multiple devices to share the same wireless medium.  
It is optimized for convenience and high data rates within relatively small areas.


### Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology used for direct communication between nearby devices.  
It is commonly used for peripherals such as keyboards, mice, headphones, and wearable devices.

Bluetooth prioritizes low power consumption and simplicity over high data throughput.  
It is well suited for continuous connections between devices that are physically close.


### Near Field Communication (NFC)

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a very short-range wireless technology designed for quick and secure interactions.  
It typically operates over distances of only a few centimeters.

NFC is commonly used for contactless payments, access cards, and device pairing.  
Its limited range reduces the risk of unintended communication.


## Closing Thought

> Connectivity is rarely noticed when it works, and immediately questioned when it does not.

Cable lines, cellular signals, and wireless technologies form the quiet foundation of everyday network access.  
They differ in range, purpose, and behavior, yet all serve the same role: bridging personal devices to shared infrastructure.

Understanding these connectivity options does not require technical mastery.  
It requires recognizing that network access is shaped by physical constraints, environmental conditions, and design trade-offs.

Before networks become diagrams or protocols, they are experienced as availability, coverage, and reliability.  
Seeing connectivity in this light helps ground later discussions of network structure in the reality of how networks are actually used.
